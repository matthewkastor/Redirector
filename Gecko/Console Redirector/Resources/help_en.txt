Usage:

"Console Redirector.exe <geckoRuntime> <args>"

Where <geckoRuntime> is the path to xulrunner.exe, firefox.exe,
  thunderbird.exe, or any other Gecko based application. If this
  argument is given as "" or the path supplied is invalid then,
  the default location for firefox.exe will be used if firefox.exe
  exists. You must provide this argument.

Where <args> are any of the arguments Firefox normally takes. This
  argument is optional.
